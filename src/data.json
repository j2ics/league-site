Through the carnage, Lieutenant Dan drove his Ferrari 488 to victory, claiming another win in his 2019 season. DC5R and Jean Sibelius rounded out the podium positions. Not all the DNFs were unaviodable. Notably, after a celebrated qualifying performance, Malgho \"New Guy\" TV disconnected when a team member reset his engine while battling for the lead.",

The rules have been the subject of heavy speculation, with rumors including a possible class change, format shakeups, and even a new Antarctica round of the championship. It can be safely assumed that the annual Bong Beach 420 will safely be back on the schedule, and that we will see a single-class series, after the confusion at the top of the 2019 championship table.",
